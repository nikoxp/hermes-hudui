# Changelog

All notable changes to hermes-hudui are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Dashboard executive summary** — the Dashboard now leads with health, spend pulse, top model, provider/gateway risk, highest-cost session, and action items derived from health, model analytics, gateway, providers, and token-cost data.
- **Plugin Hub** — new dashboard view for installed user/system plugins, dashboard extension manifests, agent plugins, runtime status, auth requirements, and safe plugin actions.
- **Gateway managed-tool visibility** — the Gateway tab now shows routing state for web search, image generation, text-to-speech, and browser automation, including managed gateway access, direct credential fallback, missing config, diagnostics, and safe actions.
- **Model analytics upgrade** — the Model tab now includes rich per-model usage: provider, token split, actual vs estimated cost, API calls, tool calls, last used, average tokens/session, capabilities, sortable columns, and session drilldown.
- **Actionable Health diagnostics** — Health now exposes more specific checks, suggested fixes, and actions, including gateway, model analytics schema, cache, websocket, sudo, provider, and database signals.
- **Health live updates** — Health reacts to websocket `data_changed` events with throttled refresh behavior so the tab updates promptly without excessive CPU churn.
- **Official Hermes Teal theme** — added the canonical Nous Hermes dashboard palette as a selectable theme.
- **Fresh release screenshots** — README assets now show the executive dashboard, managed gateway tools, model analytics, plugin hub, and responsive top bar.

### Changed
- **Dashboard memory narrative** — the previous Status panel copy now lives inside "What I Remember" with compact stats and a stronger visual treatment.
- **Gateway update action hardening** — `Update hermes` now requires a second confirmation click, displays explanatory copy, and surfaces last-run time, log path, log tail, and success/failure exit code.
- **Responsive top navigation** — the tab bar now resizes with the browser, scrolls horizontally when needed, and keeps the active tab in view.
- **README refresh** — updated feature counts, theme list, feature descriptions, and screenshots for the current UI.

### Fixed
- **Session compression visibility** — sessions now surface compression-related metadata again where available.
- **Hermes Teal contrast** — fixed unreadable badge/card text by adding shared theme aliases and tuning the HUD error color for readable contrast on teal panels.
- **Gateway/Health/Model visual regression coverage** — added focused regression tests for dashboard summary aggregation, theme registration/contrast variables, responsive shell structure, and Gateway update confirmation/status behavior.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Cron job creation UI** — `POST /api/cron` endpoint plus a "Create Job" drawer in the Cron tab. Supports interval presets (30m / 1h / 2h / 24h / custom) or raw cron expressions with a live schedule preview, optional name, prompt, repeat count, delivery target (local / origin / telegram / discord / signal / custom `platform:chat_id`), and an Advanced section for skills, script, and absolute workdir. Validation is mirrored client- and server-side: schedule required, `repeat` must be a positive integer, `workdir` must be absolute, and custom interval values must be non-empty. The hermes CLI is invoked via argv (no shell). E2E coverage in `tests/e2e/cron-create.js`.
- **Profile editing UI** — `GET /api/profiles/options`, `GET /api/profiles/{name}/edit`, and `PUT /api/profiles/{name}/edit` endpoints expose hermes profile config (model, providers, skills, soul, and runtime settings). The Profiles tab now includes an inline editor with atomic, lock-protected writes (`fcntl.flock` + `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.replace`) matching the rest of the HUD's mutation pattern. E2E coverage in `tests/e2e/profile-edit.js`.

### Fixed
- **Delete-button busy state on the Cron tab** — busy key for `DELETE /api/cron/{id}` was previously `id:null`, so the spinner never matched `isBusy('delete')`. The action key now resolves to `'delete'` and the spinner renders correctly.

### Notes
- Both new mutation endpoints inherit the HUD's localhost-trusted threat model. If you expose hermes-hudui beyond loopback, treat `POST /api/cron` and `PUT /api/profiles/{name}/edit` as RCE-equivalent surfaces (they spawn `hermes` and write profile files respectively).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Providers tab** — read-only view of connected OAuth and API-key providers from `~/.hermes/auth.json` (Nous, Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, OpenRouter, Z.AI, and any others hermes writes). Shows per-provider status (connected / expiring / expired / missing), masked token preview, expires/obtained relative time, scope, auth mode, and an ACTIVE badge for the currently selected provider.
- **Gateway tab** — live gateway status pulled from `~/.hermes/gateway_state.json` (state, PID with liveness + zombie detection, active agents, per-platform connection state, exit reason) plus two action buttons wired end-to-end: "Restart gateway" shells out to `hermes gateway restart`, "Update hermes" to `hermes update`. Each action spawns detached via `subprocess.Popen`, tees output to `~/.hermes/logs/hud/<action>.log`, and the frontend polls `GET /api/actions/<name>/status` every second, streaming the log tail and final exit code.
- **Model tab** — live capabilities for the current model, derived from `~/.hermes/models_dev_cache.json` + `config.yaml`. Capability badges (Tools / Vision / Reasoning / Structured Output), context window breakdown (auto from models.dev vs config override vs effective), max output tokens, per-1M-token pricing, release date, and knowledge cutoff.

### Changed
- **Sessions panel now shows model names again** — hermes v0.10+ moved the model ID from `model_config` JSON to a dedicated `model` column, so the collector now reads it directly (with a fallback to `model_config` for older DB rows).
- **Chat tool calls and reasoning are captured again** — hermes v0.10+ prints `session_id` to stderr instead of stdout, so the chat engine now drains stderr concurrently via a background thread. Non-session-id stderr lines are surfaced as error output on non-zero exit.
- **`collectors.utils.parse_timestamp`** now handles millisecond-epoch values and strips timezone info so naive-local datetimes compare cleanly against `datetime.now()`. Two collector-local duplicates of that logic have been removed.

### Fixed
- **gpt-5.5 pricing entry** — previously fell back to the $0/$0 "unpriced" default. Now maps to the Codex OAuth tier so session costs render non-zero. Follow-up: the models.dev entry lists $5/$30/1M for gpt-5.5; the HUD pricing table could be re-synced to models.dev as a later pass.

### Notes
- All three new tabs are read/observer-first — no session-token middleware yet. Action endpoints (`POST /api/gateway/restart`, `POST /api/hermes/update`) bind to `127.0.0.1` by default, matching the rest of the HUD's risk model.
- Interactive OAuth flows (PKCE browser redirect, device-code polling) are out of scope for this release and planned for v0.7.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **High CPU from file watcher** — watchfiles polled every 300ms over the entire `~/.hermes/` tree, which pegged a core when `state.db` is large and actively written by a running agent. Bumped `poll_delay_ms` to 2000ms (aligned with the 5s broadcast throttle) and excluded `state.db` / `state.db-wal` / `state.db-shm` / `state.db-journal` via a dedicated filter. `force_polling=True` is retained so NFS / WSL1 / VM / Docker-bind-mount setups keep working. Thanks to @louie0609c for the root-cause analysis. Closes #22.
- **Broken `install.sh` version print** — replaced the invalid `node -version` with `node --version` (thanks @CrayonL).

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Sudo tab** — surfaces sudo governance and command history from existing data. Shows approval mode, timeout, command allowlist, and security settings (from `config.yaml`); usage statistics broken down by approved/failed/blocked with a daily sparkline and subcommand type breakdown; scrollable command history extracted from `state.db` tool-output messages via FTS. Closes #14.
- **Regenerate button** — re-run the last message in chat using the AI SDK's regenerate helper; button appears after each completed assistant response.
- **Vercel AI SDK Data Stream Protocol** — replaced the custom SSE chat implementation with the AI SDK's data stream protocol for more robust streaming and future-proofing.

### Fixed
- **WebSocket / StaticFiles mount crash** — WebSocket upgrade scopes no longer fall through to the `StaticFiles` catch-all, preventing a startup crash on certain deployment configurations.
- **Vite dev proxy for `/ws`** — WebSocket connections are now correctly proxied through the Vite dev server to the backend (`:3001`), so live-reload and HUD updates work in dev mode.
- **macOS MallocStackLogging warning** — suppressed the noisy `MallocStackLogging` warning emitted on macOS when spawning subprocesses. Closes #15.
- **zsh extras install hint** — `[tui]` and `[chat]` extras are now quoted in install instructions and error messages to prevent zsh glob expansion.
- **ChatNotAvailableError message** — tightened to a single clear line.

### Performance
- **Chat streaming** — switched to `read1()` for chunked reads and tightened the frontend render throttle, reducing perceived latency on long responses.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **i18n — English + Chinese language support** — every UI string across all 13 tabs is translated. A language toggle button in the header bar switches instantly; choice persists to localStorage.
- **Chat responds in selected language** — when the UI is set to Chinese, chat messages include a language hint so the agent responds in Chinese.
- **Language toggle** — bordered button after the clock in the header, always visible regardless of tab overflow.

### Changed
- Default host binding changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` for security (contributed by @shivanraptor).

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Chat history persistence** — messages and sessions survive page refresh via localStorage. On server restart, backend sessions are re-created and message history migrated automatically.

### Fixed
- **Corrections tab — session corrections were always empty** — a dead REGEXP loop in the collector fired a `cursor.execute()` that SQLite can't handle (no built-in REGEXP support), throwing an `OperationalError` that silently aborted the function before the LIKE-based queries could run. Fixed by removing the dead loop, collapsing the 8 individual LIKE queries into one OR query, and moving `conn.close()` into a `finally` block.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Tool call visibility** — chat responses now show tool call cards (web_search, terminal, etc.) with arguments after the response finishes
- **Reasoning display** — agent thinking/reasoning blocks appear as collapsible "Thinking" sections in chat
- **Memory editing** — inline edit, delete, and add entries directly in the Memory tab (both Agent Memory and User Profile)
- **Session transcript viewer** — click any session in the Sessions tab to read the full conversation in a modal with markdown rendering and per-message token counts
- **Session search** — search bar searches session titles and full message content (FTS), results show match type and a content snippet

### Fixed
- HUD-generated chat sessions (`--source tool`) no longer appear in the Sessions tab or search results

---

## [0.2.0] — Chat + New Tabs

### Added
- **Chat tab** — Live chat with your Hermes agent
  - Multiple sessions, each with independent message history
  - Responses stream in real time (SSE)
  - Markdown rendering — headers, lists, tables, code blocks
  - Syntax-highlighted code with a copy button on hover
  - Stop button cancels a response mid-stream
  - Tool call cards and reasoning display (when agent uses tools)
- **Corrections tab** — View corrections grouped by severity (critical / major / minor)
- **Patterns tab** — Task clusters, hourly activity heatmap, repeated prompts

### Fixed
- Chat system warnings (context compression notices) no longer appear in responses
- Chat sessions are fully independent — switching sessions no longer shows the same messages
- Chat output preserves formatting and line breaks
